              Hi there! I'm a frontend developer who loves making websites
              awesome. With HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I make sure websites look
              great and work smoothly. Imagine me like a conductor leading an
              orchestra, using code to create beautiful and innovative websites.

            <h2 class="para2">
              When I'm not fixing website layouts or solving web problems, I
              enjoy friendly arguments about whether to use tabs or spaces in
              code. But don't worry, my jokes might not be super funny, but they
              won't break your browser!
            </h2>

            <h2 class="para3">
              So, get ready for a fun ride through the world of web development
              with me. Let's turn ideas into real websites, one step at a time!
